    "summary": "This topic is about understanding that the position of a digit in a number determines its value (e.g., the '2' in 250 is worth 200). It also covers rounding numbers to a given place value, like the nearest ten, hundred, or thousand, to make them easier to work with.",
    "where_to_look": "NZ Curriculum > Number & Algebra > Place Value",
    "key_formulas": [
      "Rounding Rule: Look at the digit to the right of the place you are rounding to. If it's 5 or more, round up. If it's 4 or less, keep the digit the same."
    ],
    "example": "To round 45,780 to the nearest thousand, we look at the hundreds digit (7). Since 7 is '5 or more', we round the thousands digit (5) up to 6. The result is 46,000.",
    "common_misconceptions": [
      "Confusing the place values, for example, thinking the 'tens' column is the 'hundreds' column.",
      "When rounding down, changing the digit you are rounding to (e.g., rounding 34 to 20 instead of 30)."
