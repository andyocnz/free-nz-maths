Step 2: In right triangle FGH (horizontal base), angle FGH = 43°, angle GFH = 90°. So tan(43°) = FH/FG, thus FG = FH/tan(43°) = 6.782/tan(43°) ≈ 6.782/0.9325 ≈ 7.274 cm. Step 3: In right triangle SFG (to find angle SGF), we have SF (vertical) = 4.238 cm and FG (horizontal) = 7.274 cm. tan(x) = SF/FG = 4.238/7.274 ≈ 0.5825. x = arctan(0.5825) ≈ 30.2°. Hmm, let me reconsider... Actually angle SGF is at G looking up to S. In triangle SFG: SF = 4.238 (vertical), FG = 7.274 (horizontal). Angle at F is 90°. So angle SGF: tan(angle SGF) = SF/FG = 4.238/7.274. Wait, that gives angle at G = arctan(4.238/7.274) ≈ 30.2°. But let me verify with the geometry more carefully using SG. SG = √(SF² + FG²) = √(4.238² + 7.274²) = √(17.96 + 52.91) = √70.87 ≈ 8.42 cm. Then sin(angle SGF) = SF/SG = 4.238/8.42 ≈ 0.503, so angle ≈ 30.2°. Actually checking again with correct triangle: if we want angle SGF (at vertex G), and we have right angle at F, then tan(SGF) = opposite/adjacent = SF/FG. Let me recalculate FG using the base triangle correctly. In base triangle FGH with right angle at F and angle FGH = 43°: opposite to 43° is FH, adjacent is FG. So tan(43°) = FH/FG means FG = FH/tan(43°). Using FH ≈ 6.782: FG ≈ 7.27 cm. Then angle SGF in 3D: considering vertical SF and horizontal FG forming right triangle SFG at F, angle at G = arctan(SF/FG) = arctan(4.238/7.27) ≈ 30.2°. Hmm, this seems low. Let me reconsider the angle definition...",

Bottom part: Pyramidal/triangular section. HG width = 30m, height from HG to EF = 5m. The hole tapers from 30m at bottom to 20m at top. Cross-section shows trapezoid. Looking more carefully: if symmetrical about PQ (vertical centerline), and distances marked 25m on each side from Q, then bottom width = 30m. Top section EFGH appears to be 20m wide. The shape between EFGH and HQ is like inverted pyramid or prism. Volume of trapezoidal prism section: average width = (20+30)/2 = 25m, height = 5m, depth ≈ 20m. Volume ≈ 25 × 5 × 20 = 2500 m³. Wait, examining diagram more carefully: it shows a cross-section view. Let me recalculate systematically. Top cuboid: 20 × d × 20 where d is depth into page. If depth is 20m: V1 = 8000 m³. Lower section is trapezoidal/pyramidal. Using cross-section: area of trapezoid = (1/2)(20+30)×5 = 125 m². If depth is 20m: V2 = 125 × 20 = 2500 m³. Total = 10,500 m³.

Actually from diagram measurements: if depth into page is smaller, say 20m, and recalculating... The exact answer depends on the depth dimension not clearly visible.
