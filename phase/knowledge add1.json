  "title": "Pythagorean Theorem",
  "summary": "In any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (legs).",
  "key_formulas": [
    "a² + b² = c²",
    "c = √(a² + b²)"
  ],
  "example": "If a right-angled triangle has legs of length a=3 and b=4, the hypotenuse c can be found using c² = 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25. Therefore, c = √25 = 5.",
  "common_misconceptions": [
    "The theorem only applies to right-angled triangles.",
    "Forgetting to take the square root to find the final length of the hypotenuse.",
    "Incorrectly identifying which side is the hypotenuse (it is always the longest side, opposite the right angle)."
