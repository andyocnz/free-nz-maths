# TODO / Ideas

- Senior vector visuals (Y12.G.VECTOR_OPS):
  - Current attempt shows only grid/axes. Revisit with a simple, robust approach (e.g., one arrow from origin to ⟨a,b⟩) once the coordinate-grid multi-point rendering is fully verified.
  - Ensure visuals are added via `visualData` in `year12Curriculum.json` without affecting marking logic.
