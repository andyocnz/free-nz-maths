# Project Vision – Free NZ Maths

This file is a lightweight roadmap for upcoming phases of work.

## Phase 8 – Content Expansion (Years 8 & 9)
- Add more topics and depth for Year 8 and Year 9, especially:
  - Richer geometry and measurement questions (including more visual varieties).
  - Additional number and algebra strands to cover remaining NZ curriculum gaps.
  - More statistics & probability contexts relevant to older students.

## Phase 8+ – Learning Support Features
- Add a **"Remind me what this is"** button on each question:
  - When clicked, show a short revision panel explaining the key idea for that skill (e.g. definition, key formula, small worked example).
  - Content should be skill-specific (linked to the skill ID), not generic.
  - Keep it brief and student-friendly (aimed at quick recall, not full lessons).

## Phase 9 – NCEA Alignment
- Add practice questions based on **NCEA past papers**, starting with:
  - Year 11/Level 1 style questions that still map cleanly to Year 9 skills.
  - Categorise NCEA-style questions under clearly marked topics (e.g. “NCEA practice – algebra”).
- Ensure NCEA items:
  - Are tagged clearly in curriculum data (so they can be included/excluded from practice and tests).
  - Use the same template/visual system where possible for consistency.

## General Guidelines for Future Work
- Continue to:
  - Avoid “answer in the picture” visuals.
  - Keep templates realistic and contextually sensible (no impossible triangles, negative change, etc.).
  - Make all new templates and helpers auditable via `audit.json` and `?dev` mode.
