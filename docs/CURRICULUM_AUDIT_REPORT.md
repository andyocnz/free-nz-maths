## Executive Summary

This audit compares the current curriculum templates against the official New Zealand mathematics curriculum for Years 10-12. The results reveal **significant coverage gaps** that need immediate attention.

### Key Findings

- **Total Templates**: 47 across Years 10-12
- **Total Official NZ Topics**: 559 across Years 10-12
- **Coverage**: Only **32 templates (68%)** could be matched to official topics
- **Missing Topics**: **536 official NZ topics** have NO templates
- **Unmatched Templates**: 15 templates don't clearly align with official curriculum

### Coverage by Year

## Critical Recommendations

### 1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

**Priority 1: Core Foundation Topics (Year 10)**
Create templates for these essential topics that are completely missing:
- All Number topics (A.1 - A.6)
- All Operations topics (B.1 - B.7)
- All Ratios/rates/proportions (C.1 - C.7)
- Most Percent topics (D.1 - D.6, D.8 - D.10)
- All Measurement topics (E.1 - E.6)
- All Linear equation solving topics (J.1 - J.11)
- All Inequality topics (K.1 - K.11)

**Priority 2: Fix Incorrect Mappings**
Review and correct these templates that are mapped to wrong topics:
- Y10.G.TRIG_RULES.T1 (currently mapped to algebra tiles)
- Y10.G.CIRCLE_THEOREMS.T1 (currently mapped to circle graphs instead of theorems)
- Y10.S.BIVARIATE.T1 (currently mapped to algebra tiles)
- Y10.N.FINANCIAL_RATES.T1 (currently mapped to distance)

### 2. STRUCTURAL CHANGES

**Reorganize Skill IDs to Match Official Curriculum**
- Current: `Y10.A.QUADRATIC_FORMULA`
- Recommended: Use official codes like `Y10.V.3` or create new code system aligned with NZ curriculum

**Example Mapping:**
```
Official: Y10.D.7 - Compound interest
Current:  Y10.N.FINANCIAL_COMPOUND.T1
Aligned:  Y10.D.7.T1 (or keep descriptive + add metadata)
```

### 3. COVERAGE EXPANSION

**Year 10: Add 204 missing topics** (92% gap)
**Year 11: Add 325 missing topics** (97% gap)
**Year 12: Parse official topics and create alignment**

### 4. QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS

**Review Unmatched Templates:**
- Determine if they should exist or be removed
- If they should exist, identify correct official topic mapping
- Update keywords/metadata to improve matching

**Add Curriculum Metadata:**
Every template should include:
```json
{
  "template_id": "Y10.D.7.T1",
  "official_nz_code": "Y10.D.7",
  "official_topic": "Compound interest",
  "skill_section": "Percents",
  "nz_curriculum_aligned": true
}
```
